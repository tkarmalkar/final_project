Business problem:
My Rewards has been operating for over a decade and currently boasts almost 10 million members. The more members the company has, the more value it generates for its key founding partners. Specifically, having more members for redemption partner #1 means that more people will be incentivized to visit their business for redemption, while having more members for redemption partner #2 creates greater potential for cross-selling opportunities.

Data:
I have access to a variety of data sources, including a summary snapshot of the member base, which includes information such as size, breakdown by gender, tenure, and enrollment source. I also have data on merchants for spend and basic demographics.

Methods:
I plan to use a variety of methods to analyse this data, including descriptive and unsupervised techniques such as clustering.

Main theme:
My main goal is to segment the customers into different groups (such as Platinum, Gold, and Silver) so that the company can run targeted campaigns for redemptions. By understanding the unique characteristics and preferences of each segment, the company can create more effective and personalised campaigns that will ultimately drive more business for the redemption partners.

Stretch goals:
In addition to segmenting the customers, I also hope to answer a few other questions. For example, what are the key redemption choices for the customers, and does their preference change depending on their segment? I also want to investigate how the current members are enrolling and whether there is any correlation between enrollment source and customer segment. Finally, I hope to identify any changes in spend patterns over time or among different age groups, so the company can better target the customers based on their life events and spending habits.
